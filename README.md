# Mandalorian Adventure: A Python Console Game Turned Web Application

This project is a game called Mandalorian Adventure, originally developed as a Python console-based game, now brought to life as a web application. This transformation allows users to engage with the game using a GUI instead of the console.

The game was transitioned into a web application using React and Next.js for the frontend, while leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling. This provides a more engaging and interactive user experience.

Mandalorian Adventure is an exciting game where you step into the shoes of the Mandalorian. As you navigate through different scenarios, you'll encounter various challenges and adversaries. Your mission: survive and protect the Child, while collecting Beskar and advancing through the game. Experience the thrilling adventure right in your browser!
